            <h1>Early history</h1>
            <p>During 1842–1849, Ada Lovelace translated the memoir of Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea about
                Charles
                Babbage's newest proposed machine: the Analytical Engine; she supplemented the memoir with notes that
                specified in detail a method for calculating Bernoulli numbers with the engine, recognized by most of
                historians as the world's first published computer program.[4]

                The first computer codes were specialized for their applications: e.g., Alonzo Church was able to
                express
                the lambda calculus in a formulaic way and the Turing machine was an abstraction of the operation of a
                tape-marking machine.

                Jacquard Looms and Charles Babbage's Difference Engine both had simple languages[citation needed] for
                describing the actions that these machines should perform hence they were the creators of the first
                programming language.
