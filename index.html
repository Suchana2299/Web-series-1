   <h1>Early history</h1>
        <p>During 1842–1849, Ada Lovelace translated the memoir of Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea about Charles Babbage's newest proposed machine: the Analytical Engine; she supplemented the memoir with notes that specified in detail a method for calculating Bernoulli numbers with the engine, recognized by most of historians as the world's first published computer program.[4]

        The first computer codes were specialized for their applications: e.g., Alonzo Church was able to express the lambda calculus in a formulaic way and the Turing machine was an abstraction of the operation of a tape-marking machine.
        
        Jacquard Looms and Charles Babbage's Difference Engine both had simple languages[citation needed] for describing the actions that these machines should perform hence they were the creators of the first programming language.
